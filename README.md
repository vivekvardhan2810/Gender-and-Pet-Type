# Mosaic-Plot-for-Gender-and-Pet-Type
<p>Here I had created a Small Dataset that contains information about the preferred pet types among people of different Genders (Male, Female)
   The Animals which we have used for dataset is Dog, Cat and Fish</p>
<p><b>Steps To Obtain A Mosaic Plot By using statsmodels and matplotlib:</b></p>
<p>1) We can use the statsmodels library. First, you'll need to install the library if you haven't already. You can install it using pip</p> 
<p>2) Create a dataframe from the given dataset and row it by Gender, pet and count</p>  
<p>3) Then Create a mosaic plot using the mosaic function from statsmodels and display it with the specified title</p>
<p><b>Through matplotlib:</b></p>
<p>1) Import the necessary libraries</p>
<p>2) Define the observed counts, This array represents the observed counts of each pet type for Male and Female</p>
<p>3) Create a Matplotlib figure, axis and Loop through each gender and pet type Like, code iterates through genders and pet types, creating a bar chart for each combination. The bar function is used to create bars, and the bottom parameter is used to stack the bars on top of each other</p>
<p>4) Add labels, titles, and legends, Then Display the plot</p>
