# Mosaic-Plot-for-Gender-and-Pet-Type
<p>Here I had created a Small Dataset that contains information about the preferred pet types among people of different Genders (Male, Female)
   The Animals which we have used for dataset is Dog, Cat and Fish</p>
<p><b>Steps To Obtain A Mosaic Plot By using statsmodels and matplotlib:</b></p>
<p>1) We can use the statsmodels library. First, you'll need to install the library if you haven't already. You can install it using pip</p> 
<p>2) Create a dataframe from the given dataset and row it by gender, pet and count</p>
